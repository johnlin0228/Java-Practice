1. Create a class called StockHolding to represent a stock that you have purchased. For
instance variables, it will have two floats named purchaseSharePrice and currentSharePrice, one
int named numberOfShares and one string named companyName. Create accessory methods
for the instance variables. Create two other instance methods:
-(float)costInDollars; //purchaseSharePrice * numberOfShares
-(float)valueInDollars; //currentSharePrice * numberOfShares
Populate an array with three instances of StockHolding. Display all the stocks sorted by
company name in alphabetical order
